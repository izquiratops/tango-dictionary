# Tango ðŸŽ‹

Tango is a Japanese-English dictionary that provides a web-based interface. It provides a simple way to look up Japanese words and their English translations. While it's still in development, the goal is to create a resource similar to [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org).

This project use the content provided by [JMDict Simplified](https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified). Without this valuable resource, building this dictionary would have been significantly more time-consuming.
