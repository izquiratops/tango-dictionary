# Tango - Japanese Dictionary Application

Tango is a Japanese-English dictionary that provides a web-based interface. It provides a simple way to look up Japanese words and their English translations. While it's still in development, the goal is to create a resource similar to [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org).

This project use the content provided by JMDict Simplified. Without this valuable resource, building this dictionary would have been significantly more time-consuming.

	- TANGO_VERSION
	- TANGO_MONGO_RUNS_LOCAL
	- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME (optional)
	- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD (optional)
3. Place JMdict source files in the `jmdict_source` directory
4. Run the import tool to prepare the database:
