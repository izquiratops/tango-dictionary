This website is a Japanese-English dictionary, it provides a simple way to look up Japanese words and their English translations.
While it's still in development the goal is to create a resource similar to [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org). 

This project use the content provided by [JMDict Simplified](https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified). Without this valuable resource, building this dictionary would have been significantly more time-consuming.
